# status

work in progress (though stalled now).  has two tools so far:
pdf/text to convert a pdf to text (though does not implement character
encoding/sets, and whitespace is often wrong).  pdf/walk, a tk
program for navigation the structure of a pdf.  there is no code
to render a pdf on a canvas.


# intro

this package contains a library & tools for reading pdf files.  in
the future, perhaps a pdf renderer can be build on top of this code.
there is no documentation since this is a work in progress.  feel
free to fix/improve!


# install

first, ensure a "mkconfig" file is present.  a bind/symlink to the
mkconfig of your inferno install should do.  create the directory
/dis/pdf.  now "mk install" to compile and install the files.

things to improve.
